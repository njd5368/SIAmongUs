# SI Among Us
An Among Us clone that asks computer science questions for the tasks.

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to teach computer science in an interactive way. It was made specifically for RIT's CSCI 141 course, but hopefully people use it outside of this context.
UPDATE: The plan going forward is to make the questions based off a standard text file so that anyone can make them.
